### 📌 Objective:
Build a binary classifier using Support Vector Machines with both linear and RBF kernels using the Breast Cancer Dataset.

---

### ✅ Key Steps:
- Load and preprocess Breast Cancer dataset
- Train-test split
- Train SVM with Linear & RBF Kernels
- Hyperparameter tuning (C, Gamma)
- Decision boundary visualization
- Cross-validation for model evaluation

---

### 🛠 Tools & Libraries:
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

---

### 📈 Results:
Achieved high accuracy with tuned parameters using the RBF kernel. The decision boundary visualization shows clear classification margins.
